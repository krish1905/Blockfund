# Blockfund
Blockfund is a Web3 crowdfunding app that allows users to create, view and donate to campaigns in Ethereum. Web3 is pushing the entourage of web development and with more and more VC money in crypto, I thought to myself, what better way to leverage this, than create a crowdfunding application on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Thirdweb:
Apart from the obvious programming languages, the ThirdWeb framework made the deployment of these smart contracts extremely easy and seamless, and it's something I'll continue to use on future projects
